##How do I use Pikr?
It’s easy! Once you have downloaded the app from the ‘download’ section of this site, create an in-app account. You will have instant access to all of the app’s features!
1. Create a post! Add a title, description of what you want people to vote on, and relevant photos of each option. People will be able to cast their vote for one picture, say a particular outfit, which you will then see in your profile activity page!
2. Vote! Other people are counting on your opinion to make a difficult decision. Go to the feed, filter by public or private, and swipe to see posts!
3. Connect with your friends! Add to your friends list to make sure you get trusted, personal feedback in your private feed.

Developed for Android Oreo, although compatible with newer versions of Android.
